# Infinitia

Infinitia is a project that provides tools for image processing and neural network applications. Currently, the platform includes an image processing tool for applying basic filters, with plans to extend functionality in the future

## Features

### Image Processing Tool

-   **Title:** Image Processing

-   **Description:** Apply filters and effects to your images. (Note: These algorithms are custom implementations, not the most optimized in terms of performance like those in OpenCV.)

-   **Badge:** ðŸ†• New (indicating recently added features)

-   **Available Filters:**

    -   **Normal:** Restores the image to its original state.

    -   **Gray:** Converts the image to shades of gray.

    -   **Black & White (B&W):** Converts the image to black and white using a fixed threshold.

    -   **Otsu:** Applies automatic thresholding for optimal binarization.
